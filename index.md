## Workshop Series Outline

### Why Programming Workshops?

701’s programmers are running programming workshops in an effort to teach essential skills to all NORTH robotics members.

For Everyone: This opportunity is open to all members of all NK teams, and the skills we will be teaching _don’t just apply to programmers._ **A defining trait of the strongest FTC teams is that their members are all experts in their specific field, but also have intermediate skills in every other aspect of robotics.** Electronics and Programming are arguably the most important skills for _everyone on the team_ to have, so we encourage everyone to browse our next five weeks of offerings and pick something that interests you. In particular, we would strongly recommend that as a baseline, **at least two people on each team register for our Intro Part I Workshop**.

Our workshop series has four parts, spanning the last week of September and the first three weeks of October. Each part will take place during a Tuesday or Thursday meeting. **Plan for these workshops to span the entire meeting.**

For our Programmers: **All parts of this series are mandatory for all programmers** in NORTH robotics. We understand that the Intro Part I workshop may seem trivial to some of our seasoned programmers, but we would like everyone to attend to keep us all on the same page. _If you are an expert in a topic, we would love for you to help us teach that section._

### Overview

Our workshop series has four parts, spanning the last week of September and the first three weeks of October. Each part will take place during a Tuesday meeting. Plan for these workshops to span the entire meeting.

**We recommend on taking all courses up to the most advanced course you are qualified to take. For example, if you plan on taking Advanced Series Part II, we recommend on taking Intro Series Part I and II as well as the Advanced Series Part I.**

Intro Series Part I is an extremely basic course. It does not require preemptive knowledge of the Java language. It will cover the extreme basics of electronics in FTC, including servo programmers, the REV hardware client, and robot configuration files.

Intro Series Part II will cover everything we recommend a freshmen team know for their first year with FTC. In this workshop, we will cover give an overview of the tools used to program an FTC robot and the essential skills required to use these tools. We will also cover the basics of TeleOp drive algorithms, basics of programming Autonomous actions, basics of source control, and additional resources that can help you learn programming at this level.

The Advanced Series, spanning two meetings, will encompass Roadrunner and EasyOpenCV - two skills that **SEPARATE REGIONAL TEAMS FROM WORLDS-LEVEL TEAMS. We are eager to teach these skills to anyone who is eager to learn.**

## Prerequisites

A big part of this series is connecting you with the resources you need to grow and develop your programming skills. Don't think of the prerequisites as homework, but as the aforementioned resources. The whole point of this series is for you to learn, and we're telling you that you need to complete the following courses and read the following documentation to be successful in our workshops. Keep these resources in mind so you can use them in the future if you need to remember something, or if a freshman team asks you for help.
